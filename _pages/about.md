**Doyun Kwon** is a Researcher at [Exosystems](https://www.exosystems.io/), specializing in biomedical signal processing and artificial intelligence.

I am actively working on developing deep learning models to analyze biosignals, particularly **Electromyography (EMG)**, for the diagnosis and assessment of neuromuscular disorders. My primary research interest lies in creating AI-based digital biomarkers for **Sarcopenia** and **Parkinson's disease**.

My goal is to leverage physiological data to build robust diagnostic tools that can assist in early detection and personalized rehabilitation strategies.

Currently, I am focusing on:
* **Deep Learning for Biosignals**: Analyzing EMG signals to estimate muscle architecture parameters.
* **Digital Healthcare**: Developing AI models for the diagnosis of Sarcopenia and Parkinson's disease.
* **Rehabilitation AI**: Researching AI agents for stroke rehabilitation assistance.
